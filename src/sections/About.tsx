                Hi! I'm Matias, a 22 years old developer from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
                who is passionate about technology and the creative solutions 
                that programming can offer. I have a strong foundation in 
                several programming languages, including JavaScript, Rust, and 
                Elixir, and I enjoy exploring new technologies to expand 
                my skillset. I have experience working on various projects, 
                both independently and as part of a team, and I'm always 
                eager to learn and collaborate with others to create great software.

                When I'm not tinkering
                with code, you can usually find me drinking mate ðŸ§‰, hanging
                out with friends or listening to music (or maybe doing all three!).
